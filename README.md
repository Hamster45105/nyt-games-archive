# Wordle Archive

This repository contains a simple website that displays an archive of Wordle solutions. The solutions are fetched from the New York Times Wordle API and stored in a local JSON file daily.

**Warning!** May contain spoilers! Answers are displayed for the next 25 days as well!

The list is available at the [Wordle Archive site](https://hamster45105.github.io/wordle-archive/)
